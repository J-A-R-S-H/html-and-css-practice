# html-and-css-practice
Hello, this is a repo made for practice mostly. During my free time I just practice some HTML and CSS concepts I learn that I read through from MDN.
I then try to apply them with different files and so forth. This is more so for just reinforcement on the material that I've read through and just try 
it out on my own.
